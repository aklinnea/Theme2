                Did you know that our star, 
                the Sun, 
                is just one of hundreds of billions of stars 
                swirling within an enormous cosmic place called the Milky Way Galaxy?

          <h3>The Milky Way</h3>
            <p>The Milky Way is a huge collection of stars, dust and gas. 
            <br>
            It’s called a spiral galaxy because if you could view it from the top or bottom, 
            <br>
            it would look like a spinning pinwheel. 
            The Sun is located on one of the spiral arms, 
            <br>
            about 25,000 light-years away from the center of the galaxy.
            <br>
            Even if you could travel at the speed of light (300,000 kilometers, or 186,000 miles, per second),
            <br>
            it would take you about 25,000 years to reach the middle of the Milky Way.</p>
